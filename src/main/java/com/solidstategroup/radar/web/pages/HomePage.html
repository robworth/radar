                <p>Welcome to the homepage of the UK Registry for Rare Kidney Diseases, acronym
                    RaDaR. </p>


                <p>The purpose of the registry is to assemble cohorts of patients whose kidney
                    disease is thoroughly investigated and characterised. Patients in the registry
                    can then be approached to participate in "translational" research. Translational
                    research aims to connect the basic scientific investigation of a disease to
                    tangible benefit for the patient. Benefits might include better diagnosis,
                    patient information, treatment trials, and ultimately better care.</p>

                <p>Patient involvement in the registry is strongly encouraged. </p>

                <p>RaDaR is an initiative of the Renal Association and the British Association for
                    Paediatric Nephrology. It operates within the UK Renal Registry, and its governance
                    lies with the Renal Association. The initiative is supported by the  Kidney Research
                    UK and the British Kidney Patients Association. </p>
